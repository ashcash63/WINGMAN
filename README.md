# Wingman ü§ù  

## Our Project  
We set out to make communication easier for students‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs starting a conversation, keeping it going, or following up. From setting up a coffee chat on LinkedIn to chatting on Tinder, our tool acts as a wingman for better messaging.

- AI chat summaries  
- Assistants for both casual and professional replies  
- Language clarification tools to make messages context-appropriate
